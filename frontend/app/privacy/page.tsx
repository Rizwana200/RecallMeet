          When you use RecallMeet, we collect the following categories of

          We use the information we collect to provide and improve the service,

              AI service provider

            — transcription, summarization, and chat are powered by an AI
            service provider. Portions of your meeting content may be processed
            by this provider to generate transcripts, summaries, and answers.

        <p>
          You can delete individual meetings at any time from within the app.
          Deleting a meeting removes the uploaded recording and the associated
          transcript and summary data. We do not retain these records beyond
          what is needed to operate the service.
